## 👋 Hello, everyone! 
### My name is Kyubum Han, I am a Front end developer 🖥
**As my field major is Informatics, especailly human computer interaction, I have had various opportunities to design and code user interfaces. However, every time I did my team projects, I usually selected to design rather than coding because I was just aware of what front end programming is, but I certainly did not know how I can work with or apply to create dynamic website.** <br><br>
**However, there was a one project that totally changed my mind about front end development. During the projcet, I passed high fidelity prototyping to my other team member as usual for coding and looked how my design was turned into real website. It was absolutely amazing and I was fascinated by the productive and creative process. At this point, I have decided to take a new challenge by taking user interaction courses in school and studying front end development from web resources.** <br><br>
**Ever since I began to study front end development, every step I have gone through made me realize about my capabilities as a front end developer and understand how to cooperate with a designer to create better quality of product for end users. I am a quick learner and have a passion to code and design user interfaces. I hope I can face more challenges to advance my skills and be a great front end developer who is self starter with a keen eye for the improvement.**
